Error handling

Things go wrong, especially when you're getting data from a remote server. The HeroService.getHeroes() method should catch errors and do
something appropriate.

To catch errors, you "pipe" the observable result from http.get() through an RxJS catchError() operator.

Import the catchError symbol from rxjs/operators, along with some other operators you'll need later.

/*
HttpClient
----------
HttpClient methods return one value

All HttpClient methods return an RxJS Observable of something.

HTTP is a request/response protocol. You make a request, it returns a single response.

In general, an observable can return multiple values over time. An observable from HttpClient always emits a single value and then
completes, never to emit again.

This particular HttpClient.get() call returns an Observable<Hero[]>; that is, "an observable of hero arrays". In practice, it will only
return a single hero array.
HttpClient.get() returns response data

HttpClient.get() returns the body of the response as an untyped JSON object by default. Applying the optional type specifier, <Hero[]> ,
adds TypeScript capabilities, which reduce errors during compile time.

The server's data API determines the shape of the JSON data. The Tour of Heroes data API returns the hero data as an array.

Other APIs may bury the data that you want within an object. You might have to dig that data out by processing the Observable result with
the RxJS map() operator.

Although not discussed here, there's an example of map() in the getHeroNo404() method included in the sample source code.

/**
 * @Injectable() services
 *
 * Notice that the new service imports the Angular Injectable symbol and annotates the class with the @Injectable() decorator. This marks
 * the class as one that participates in the dependency injection system. The HeroService class is going to provide an injectable service,
 * and it can also have its own injected dependencies.
 * The @Injectable() decorator accepts a metadata object for the service, the same way the @Component() decorator did for your component
 * classes.
 *
 * Get hero data
 *
 * The HeroService could get hero data from anywhereâ€”a web service, local storage, or a mock data source.
 * Removing data access from components means you can change your mind about the implementation anytime, without touching any components.
 * They don't know how the service works.
 *
 * The implementation in this tutorial will continue to deliver mock heroes.
 */

/*
Provide the HeroService

You must make the HeroService available to the dependency injection system before Angular can inject it into the HeroesComponent by
registering a provider. A provider is something that can create or deliver a service; in this case, it instantiates the HeroService class to
provide the service.
To make sure that the HeroService can provide this service, register it with the injector, which is the object that is responsible for
choosing and injecting the provider where the app requires it.
By default, the Angular CLI command ng generate service registers a provider with the root injector for your service by including provider
metadata, that is providedIn: 'root' in the @Injectable() decorator.

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})

When you provide the service at the root level, Angular creates a single, shared instance of HeroService and injects into any class that
asks for it. Registering the provider in the @Injectable metadata also allows Angular to optimize an app by removing the service if it turns
out not to be used after all.
 */
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class HeroService {

  private heroesUrl = 'api/heroes';  // URL to web api

  /*
  messageService

  which is injected into the HeroesComponent.
  */

    private http: HttpClient,

  .pipe
  Now extend the observable result with the pipe() method and give it a catchError() operator.

  tap()
  Tap into the Observable:
  The HeroService methods will tap into the flow of observable values and send a message, via the log() method, to the message area at the
  bottom of the page.
  They'll do that with the RxJS tap() operator, which looks at the observable values, does something with those values, and passes them
  along. The tap() call back doesn't touch the values themselves.
  Here is the final version of getHeroes() with the tap() that logs the operation.

  getHeroes(): Observable<Hero[]> {
    // direct log to messageService
